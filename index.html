            <h2>Why Ghost?</h2>
            <h3>If you have Ghost, you have everything</h3>
            <p>
              Or a bit of everything, at least. Some have described their music
              as the love child of ABBA and Iron Maiden, others have named it
              "Scooby-Doom". In truth, their style is hard to pin down but maybe
              that's what makes them so appealing. They blend catchy pop
              melodies with heavy metal, creating a unique sound with strong
              hooks, evolving theatricality, elaborate stage shows, and clever,
              lore-driven lyrics that appeal to both metalheads and mainstream
              rock fans.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tobias Forge, the mastermind, crafts compelling narratives and
              consistently reinvents the band's look and sound with each album
              cycle, drawing from diverse influences like Blue Öyster Cult,
              Alice Cooper, and classic rock. Their live shows are nothing short
              of spectacular, with creative storytelling, high production values
              and serious musicianship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Formed in 2006, the band have released six studio albums, which
              have earned them international recognition. The band's sixth
              studio album, Skeletá, was released in 2025; it subsequently
              became their first number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.
